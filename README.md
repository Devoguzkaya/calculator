# 🧮 Sprint 10 – Reducer Calculator

This project was developed as part of the **Workintech Frontend training program**, focusing on the **Reducer pattern** in React.  
The goal was to build a functional calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations using **state management with the `useReducer` hook**.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand and apply the **Reducer pattern** in React
- Learn how to manage state with `useReducer`
- Implement **action creators** and reducer logic for dynamic updates
- Strengthen understanding of **component structure and event handling**
- Reinforce debugging and testing practices through iterative development

## ⚙️ Application Overview

The calculator allows users to:

- Perform basic operations: addition, subtraction, and multiplication
- Change the active operator dynamically (`+`, `-`, `*`)
- Use memory functions:
  - **M+** → Store current total in memory
  - **MR** → Recall value from memory
  - **MC** → Clear memory
- Reset the display with **CE**
- View the real-time total in a clean and minimal UI

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- **React** (with `useReducer` hook)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Vite** (development environment)
- **CSS / Flexbox** (for layout and styling)

## 💡 Key Takeaways

This project helped reinforce the **core concepts of reducer-based state management**.  
By connecting UI components with actions and a centralized reducer, the application demonstrates how to build predictable, testable, and scalable state logic in React.
